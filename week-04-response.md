Create a new markdown file named 'week-04-response.md' and save it in your 'idea-120-responses' repository project folder. 
In this file, give an example of hot media and an example of cold media with your reasoning for each. Provide images. 

Hot and Cold Media is the characteristics of the medium instead of the content of the medium according to Marshall McLuhan. 
An example of hot media, is a movie because, it is already doing a lot of the work portraying the vision and not much is left for us to fill in. 
An example of cold media, is a tv because, we have to determine what the author or director wants to show us, we put the work into it, like comic books. 
Hot media most of the time, involves us without much stimulation, for instance, the radio, movies, tiktok (in modern times) and cold media, is little stimulation and 
we have to participate more, for instance, tvs, cartoons, comic books.
