Create a new markdown document in your 'idea-120-responses' folder called 'week-12-anthropy.md' and discuss in about 2 paragraphs how accessibility in gaming and coding can help improve video games. 
Think about what we can gain from a larger number of voices participating in creating games and what other kinds of media (e.g. theater, physical games) could also benefit from using 'game' creation tools.

By encouraging inclusiveness and diversity in the creation process, accessibility in gaming and coding has the potential to completely transform the video game industry. 
The game businesses could benefit from new insights and creative ideas when more voices, including those, from underrepresented groups and those with different abilities work together in game creation. 
Developers may make their games accessible to a wider audience, by including accessibility features more open to the public, for example, adjustable controls, subtitles, and choices for various sensory experiences. 
This improves gameplay for everyone since varied viewpoints inspire more imaginative and inclusive game designs, which benefits both players with disabilities and general gamers alike. 
Furthermore, accessibility in coding and gaming has an influence that goes beyond, that can be advantageous to other media, like live performances and tangible games. 
Through the use of game production tools, professionals in various domains may incorporate interactive features, flexible technology, and adaptable experiences to captivate viewers in novel and captivating ways. 
Theater shows, for instance, may blur the boundaries between actor and spectator by including the audience in interactive narrative experiences. 
Similarly, physical games may make use of game design ideas to develop inclusive experiences that cater to players with various physical capabilities, encouraging inclusivity and social engagement. 
By embracing accessibility in gaming and coding, artists working in a variety of mediums could pioneer and create new things, which in turn promotes inclusion, creativity, and innovation.
