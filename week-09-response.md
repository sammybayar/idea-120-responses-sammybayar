discuss in about 2 paragraphs what methods outlined by O'Neil and Chalabi you believe you're subject to when using tools and consuming media on the internet. 
Would the internet be more useful and egalitarian without these methods (targeted ads, shaping interactions to content with specific design), or is it useful 
to direct users because your message could otherwise be lost among the sea of online content?

I think it is very interesting how Cathy O'Neil is a mathematician because I can never do math. I also think it is really cool how she uses math to decipher algorithms 
to me, that is unheard of. When I am using the internet, I don't really think about the mathematical part of it, I just google what I need to look up and go from there, 
but I never thought that use of big data and advertisements can lead to racism and other issues. I believe O'Neil talks about how there are algorithms to predict crimes, and I don't really understand how that works because, it is impossible to predict crimes, and I feel like that would come with prejudice and lawsuits. I believe o"Neil and Chalabi emphasize the potential biases and unexpected consequences that are put into algorithms controlling multiple aspect of our virtual internet lives. When using online tools and consuming the media on the internet, we come into contact with ads that we interacted with in the past (I look up dog food and get ads for different dog food ads). With those experiences, I believe they are aimed to boost our experiences and make us buy but it can turn to bad quickly, by reinforcing bad biases, create filter bubbles, and manipulate user behavior. 

While the internet being completely unfiltered, could be egalitarian, the reality is, there is so much content on the internet, it can overwhelm us, making it difficult to find reliable sources. Targeted ads and Algorithmic content can be used as guides, guiding users to content that they like. I believe (and I could be wrong) that we should make a balance between unfiltered and targeted ads. To make sure the user has a good experience by finding content towards their interests, without comprising on the user's data by getting into their data, or putting on harmful biases that can hurt the users. I believe the internet's utility and egalitarianism, depends on responsinble algorithmic designs that can't be corrupted, and prioritizes privacy, fairness, equality, without corrupt businesses behind the algorithms pushing ads to fuel their pockets.
