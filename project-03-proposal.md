So originally my idea for my non-linear narrative game was going to be a POV game: dating simualator, where you go on a date with someone and you see how the outcome goes, 
but I decided against it, because, I have no experience in dates so how am I going to make a dating simulator game? My second idea was POV: you are the night shift guard at 
Freddy Fazbear's pizzeria. But then, I realized that all of my projects are surrounding FNAF. \
So this is my game idea. 
POV: you live in chicago. 
There will be four branches in the story: the business man who works in corporate Chicago, and hates his life. The guppy adults who drink kombucha and hang around the Wicker 
Park/Logan Sqaure area, listens to Mitski and wears Doc Martens, the college student who takes the CTA everyday and works a retail job, and the crackhead on the CTA you encounter, 
who asks you for a dollar, does unpredictable actions, gets into fights with random people for no reason, and switches cars while the CTA train is moving. And depending on who you 
pick in the intro, you get their point of view. So for example, the start screen would look something like this: 

"you are apart of Chicago, which resident will you be? 
1.the business man 
2.the hipster 
3.the college student 
4.the crackhead." 

and then based off what you chose, you get a POV and you decide what they do next, so for example: 

you chose the business man 

"it is late hours at the office, the only people left in the office is you and your front desk assistant Kaitlyn. 
do you start an affair or do you go home to your wife?" 

and then you choose if the business man starts an affair or not, and based on those choices you get an ending. 
I thought this would be an fun experiment for the citizens of Chicago, and I guess an inside joke for anyone living in Chicago.
