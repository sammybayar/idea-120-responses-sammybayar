In this response, provide an example of a kind of image that would be read differently if it were seen in another medium (for example, posts by Instagram 'influencers', food photography, or click-bait news articles). What are the 'three messages' (as laid out by Barthes) this kind of image contains?

To Barthes, an advertisement contains three types of messages in its ads: a linguistic message, and two messages encoded in the image: the denoted one (the object) 
and the connoted, the symbolic one. 
with this in mind, I chose, the Silence of the Lambs movie poster. The linguistic message of the poster is the title, "The Silence of the Lambs."
The denoted object is I believe is Jodie Foster's face in the background or a random woman, and the symbolic message is the cicada/butterfly on the woman's mouth, 
with her red eyes. 

I think this movie poster could be read differently as the cover of a book instead of a movie, (even though it is based on a book).
